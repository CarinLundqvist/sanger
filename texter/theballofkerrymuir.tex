\begin{song}{The ball of Kerrymuir}{theballofkerrymuir}
\begin{vers}
There were four-and-twenty virgins\\
coming up from Inverness,\\
and when the ball was over there were\\
four-and-twenty less.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls to your partner\\
and your arse against the wall.\\
If you don't get fucked on a Saturday night,\\
you'll never get fucked at all.
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
There was fucking in the kitchen,\\
there was fucking in the halls,\\
you couldn't hear the music\\
for the clanging of the balls.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls ...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The village cripple he was there, he wasn't up too much.\\
He lined them up against the wall,and fucked them with his crutch.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls ...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The village idiot he was there, sitting on a pole.\\
He pulled his foreskin over his head, and whistled through the hole.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Now little Tommy he was there, but he was only eight.\\
He couldn't fuck the women, so he had to masturbate.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The postman, he was also there, the poor man had the pox.\\
He couldn't fuck the lassies, so he fucked the letter-box.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The examinator, he was there, working out a sum;\\
he figured out by logarithms, the time that he would come.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Jock the parson, he was there, it was a bloody shame;\\
loved a lassie thirty times and never knew her name.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Winston Churchill, he was there, down behind the bar,\\
and when he couldn't get it up, he used his big cigar.\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
And when the ball was over, then everyone confessed.\\
They all enjoyed the music but the fucking was the best!\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls...\\
\end{vers}
\end{song}
