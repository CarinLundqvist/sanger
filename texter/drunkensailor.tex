\begin{vers}
Put him in the longboat till he's sober..\\

\begin{vers}
Pull out the plug and wet him all over..\\

\begin{vers}
Give him a hair of the dog that bit him..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Put him in the scuppers with a hose-pipe on him..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Shave his head with a rusty razor..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Put him in the bed with the captain's daughter..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Take him to McDonalds and buy him a burger..\\
